      <p>I believe my social and personal identity align and are unique. I am generally a more reserved person and I prefer to be by myself rather than with others in most situations. Emotionally I'm extremely stable; being neutral most of the time while very rarely dropping into extreme emotions like sadness or anger. I would describe myself as laid back and I would think other people would describe me like that too.</p>

      <p>My name has no meaning to me. I only use it as a label to be able to identify whether someone is talking to me or not. I don't believe names have any deep meaning; to me they are just labels used for quality of life. As for family, I believe it has cultural and some emotional meaning because it is who you usually grow up and spend your life with. My life with my family is also laid back, but we all support each other when it’s needed.</p>

      <p>For important places, mine would be my room and my room only. I don’t enjoy being anywhere else than it and it gives me an area to relax and do whatever I want. It’s also important to me because I spend most of my time there. If the day was divided into thirds, I would spend about ⅔ of it in my room either sleeping, being still, or relaxing.</p>

      <p>My values are to uphold modesty and be the only thing I need. I try to dress in vague clothes and not stand out; I like to blend in so I don't have extra work to deal with. Being the only thing I need means to not rely on anyone or anything to regulate myself. I only have 1 goal in life and that is to get rich. The desire for anything like m</p>

      <p>Music does not interest me in any way. I don't think it would be able to accurately describe who I am as a person either. I sometimes listen to music, but when I do it's only for a minute or so and then I go back to whatever I was doing. Music does not benefit me or help with anything emotionally or psychologically related. It may be helpful to other people, but not to me.</p>

      <p>My family doesn't have any widely accepted traditions or rituals. Sometimes we will watch a movie, but those times are completely random and different each time. No one really says anything about a “family movie night”, instead it just happens. I know other people have serious rituals and traditions though, but I am just not one of those people.</p>

      <p>I am bi racial, which means I am half 1 race and half another. I’m Indonesian and South African, and I inherit some of the traits from both races. For example, I have the same skin color as people from Indonesia, but I don't have monolids. I inherited some of the features that cause monolids though, so at times it may look like I have them since the features that cause monolids mixed with the features that cause double eyelids, which results in a very low eye crease. Race greatly impacts my life, even without normalized racism, there have still been people that believe I'm lower because of my skin color. I also notice subtle racial remarks that other people wouldn't see. Race does not play a major role in my social life, I don't make friends or speak to people just based on their skin color and other features.</p>

      <p>Gender greatly influences my identity. I am a male, so I will assume the male roles of the house. If I were to get married, I would take on the role of providing money and a home. Gender greatly affects my social identity because I don’t try to get feminine traits and characteristics, instead I aim for masculinity. I also try to give more masculine emotional responses. In short, gender affects my life significantly because it influences the decisions I make and what traits I have.</p>
